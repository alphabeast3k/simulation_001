This is a game that I decided to start when I had no connection on a plane, just some assests and the pygame documentation. 

After the flight I continued using ingenuity and some coding assist but mostly wanted to see hoe far I can go. 

Currently not really functional but alot of the base functionality is created.

Python version used for developing: 3.14
